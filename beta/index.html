            <h2>Before</h2>
            <nav class="bfr"> <!--pop out menu?-->
                <div id="menu_b">

                    <h3>Menu</h3>
                    <p>In the image below, when you hover over the menu, only the text gets lighter. Its a very subtle and it may be hard to notice since the change isnt that noticable.
                    </p>
                    <img src="pic/hover_b.png" alt="hover current">

                    <p>However, with the image below, the background color becomes red as a menu drops down, ONLY after you clicked the button. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="pic/opening_b.png" alt="opening current">

                    <p>Due to the drop down like this, it causes the menu to have a scroll bar for itself to the right of the menu

                    <h3>Search Bar</h3>
                    <p>Another part I want to fix is the search bar. There is the icon at the top right with the magnifying glass. When you hover over the icon, no major noticable feedback is seen. As with the menu, the icon gets lighter/brighter in color which took me a while to notice this happening.
                    </p>

                    <img src="pic/screen.png" alt="home screen">

                    <p>The search bar slides into view from the right side of the screen with text of SEARCH. However this sliding across seemed weird to me in that you can see the transparent box that makes the rest of the screen darker slide in with the search bar.This box doesn't quite look like a search bar and only a rectangle with text.

                    <h3>Menu</h3>
                    <p>One of the changes I want to make here is the menu button to highlight the whole thing and not just the text getting lighter when you hover over it.
                    </p>
                    <img src="pic/hover_a.png" alt="hover current">

                    <p>Then with the drop down, I wish to have it slide out to prevent the scroll bar from apearing when the menu gets too long. It will be a slow fade in as it slides out from the right of the menu outwards to the left.

                        <li>Rule: The background color will turn red to indicate its a button when hovered. When clicked, the submenu will slide out from the right of the menu, left to right</li>
                        <li>Feedback: The background color will change upon a trigger. The submenu will show up when menu button is clicked on.</li>
                        <li>Loops & Modes: One mode is changed. New information (the sub menu) will slide out revealing itself. </li>

                    <h3>Search Bar</h3>

                    <p>With the search bar, the adjustments I want to make is to have the icons at the top left to be a bit clearer that its a button by having the whole icon in a rectangle to light up. As for the input field itself, have it show up as a drop down and have the darkened filter fade in as to sliding in from the side.I also wanted it to not be as large and imposing as the original version and made the rectangle thinner.

                        <li>Feedback: 
                        If hovered, the icon will get lighter.Once clicked, the pages darkens as the search bar drops down from the height of the icon. </li>
                        <li>Loops & Modes: One mode. The search bar gets revealed upon click of the search icon. </li>

                <p>
                    For refernece of how I might go about coding the changes is with this type of CSS menu animation. What I like about this specific animation is how there are exsisting content on the page that the menu slides out from behind that div to reveal more options. This will work great with the menu I want to adjust.
