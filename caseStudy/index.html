        <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>I am Britney Tu, a student studying UX and UI at Drexel University. This project was to find and customize a complex microinteraction to fit personal needs. I had to learn jQuery to adjust the code to make the interaction my own. Overall I belive this project was very useful with learning how to work with pre-existing sample code.</p>
        <h3>Context & Challenge</h3>
            <p>I am a student studying UX and UI at Drexel University. This microinteraction was researched and adjusted for the use to learn about microinteractions as a whole. I specifically chose a multi-tiered dropdown menu since I haven't had much experience with creating one and knew it would be useful for future projects.</p>
            <p>The project exist to learn about different microinteractions. This gives the opportunity to customize it to each individual needs. My main goal for this particular microinteraction was to allow drop downs from each of the three categories and made sure it flowed nicely together.</p>
        <h3>Process & Insight</h3>
            <p>Knowing the idea of what I wanted to create I was able to find some sample code and adjusted it as I needed. Once I was able to get the code working locally, I made my nessary adjustments.</p>
                <h4>Code/Dev</h4>
                    <img src="menu_img.png" alt="original drop down">
                    <p>I found this sample code on W3Schools' webite. They have very useful sample code that are simple and straight forward to demonstrate a particular topic. This complex microinteraction has a mix of HTMl, CSS, and jQuery.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned earlier, jQuery was used. While it wasn't required for the assignment as it wasn't taught in any of my previous classes, I really enjoyed how this microinteraction worked so I researched on my own some basic syntax to customize the reference code to what I orignally wanted to make.</p>

                        <br>
                    </div>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p id="final">After some researching and trial and error, the microinteraction is completed. Once the user clicks the filter or the categories, the list of categories or the submenu will get revealed. If the user clicks on another category, the previous one closes as the one clicked gets opened. When the user clicks outside the dropdown menu or closes the filter, all the drop downs gets collapsed. Below is a gif & a link to the demo of the microinteraction.</p>

                <br>
            </div>
        <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>I belive this project is a success since I was able to customize the interaction to the way I initially intended. I learned some basic jQuery, which wasn't too difficult since it had similar syntax with javaScript in which I learned before. In the future, I would research more on jQuery or any other possible ways to create an effective drop down menu. Overall with this project, I learned a lot and hope to use this dropdown in many furture projects.</p>
